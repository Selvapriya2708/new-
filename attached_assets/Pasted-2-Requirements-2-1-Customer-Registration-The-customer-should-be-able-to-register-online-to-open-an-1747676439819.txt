done. The customer should be able to logon to the site only after that. Customer can either have
a Savings account or a Current account.

a customer can hold with the bank. The customer will have to send an online request to the bank
for new account creation.

Customers should not be able to withdraw more than a configured amount on a day. A minimum
balance must be maintained at all times. This amount must be configurable.
2.3.2. Current Account

account.
A current account can have the facility of having a zero balance.
Customers should be able to avail of overdraft facility on their current accounts. If overdraft facility
is availed, then the bank will charge a rate of interest on the overdraft amount to the customer.
This rate of interest will be same for all current accounts, irrespective of the amount being
withdrawn as overdraft.
Overdraft Charges Calculation

overdraft charges will be added to the balance, resulting in the balance going down further in
negative territory.
